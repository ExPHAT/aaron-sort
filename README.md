Twitter Sort
==========

Twitter Sort is a sorting algorithm that takes advantage of the Twitter API.
You pass the script the numbers you would like sorted and it will tweet
a request asking for somebody to sort them. When someone replies with
a sorted version of the numbers, it will print them to the console 
and return.

Setup
-----
Ensure you have the `tweepy` module installed

Usage
